## Build instructions

For my website, clone this repository into vscode and make sure you have the `Live Server` extension installed. Then, right-click on `index.html`, and choose "Open with live server." This should allow the JavaScript to run.

Instead, you can access the website at <https://masonj5002.github.io/cpsc-349-Personal-Portfolio/index.html>
